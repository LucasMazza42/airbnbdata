# airbnbdata

- This repository is meant for me to explore the applications of the Kmeans clustering on AirBNB data in NYC 
- One of the first questions I looked at was clustering based off of longitude and latitude data 
- For now I decided to look at just apartments located in Brooklyn 
- Number of clusters:

- Based off the plot I thought 4 or 5 clusters might be best, but decided to go with 5 clusters based off the context of the situation 
- Three clusters could have also been used here as it covers the most amount of error
- Here are the clusters plotted:

-These plots can help us to identify where new houses may fall, patterns in the neighborhood, or maybe some anamolies
- For example, there is much less density of the AirBnb's between 40.5 degree and 40.65 degree latitude. 
- As well as, there is a high density of airBnB's between 40.65 and 40.75 latitude
- Overall, this area is highly populated with options. 
- If we were to take a look at the area where these point are falling at a map, the direct center falls on this area.

- Some insights from this are that there is a public school located in this area, large parks, hotels, etc. 
- Basically we can say this is a very livable area.
